# 4ADS-TAD

The repository for the 4ADS final Data Structure assignment

## About

In this project, besides implementing a abstract type of data (TAD, in portuguese), with serialization and relationships,
we've implemented a command system, with a command parser, that enables the user to write their own queries to interact with the Entity system.
